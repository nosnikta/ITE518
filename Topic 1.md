# Week 1 - Introduction to Agile
### Description
Agile began a fast-growing concept and methodology for the development of software and has been expanding and enveloping other types of development and industries. As a broad concept Agile has become a fundamental principle upon which more specific methodologies and concepts have been built – or in some cases adopted. Methods such as **SCRUM, XP, Kanban, Lean** and more have their niches, their strengths and weaknesses depending upon their application. However they are all referred to as “agile” principles. So what defines Agile?

This topic explores the concepts and philosophies that underpin Agile thinking, its origins and differences, advantages and benefits. We consider the functional, organizational and psychological foundation of Agile and its ongoing rise and favour in business.

### Intended Learning
Students will explore the concepts which featured in the early stages of Agile development, the business, technology and social changes which influenced it, and the core attributes of the Agile philosophy. The distinctions between Agile and chaotic will be investigated as some myths surrounding the free and relaxed nature of Agile will also be analysed. Students will gain a deeper understanding of how, why and where Agile began and gain an appreciation for its role in solution delivery.

### Topic Mastery
When considering your mastery of this topic you should satisfy yourself that you have obtained the following key pieces of knowledge, that you can answer the questions to ponder, and that you can explain the considerations below to a fellow professional.
1. Understand the origins of Agile, the forces that led to its creation and which continue to shape its evolution.
1. Be clear on the true definition of Agile and not confuse it with the myths and assumptions.
1. Know that compared to traditional project management Agile is a change of structure, not a lack of structure.

### Questions to Ponder
Consider the following questions as a guide to understanding this topic. Ask yourself how well you understand these principles and how satisfied you are that you can explain them.

1. Why are we so focused on decisions when we compare methodologies?
1. How has Agile become confused with merely the absence of planning?
1. Why is the use of Agile spreading to other areas beyond its initial creation?
1. How have the changes in our relationship with information influenced the evolution of Agile principles?
1. What are the most important considerations of Agile thinking and how do they differ from the  more traditional planned approach?

### Considerations
As we explore the foundation of Agile take these considerations into account when forming your own opinions.

* Agile is not a distinct methodology in itself, but is more of a philosophy or approach.
* Agile is growing for some specific and identifiable reasons, but where are those forces taking us next?
* A lot of proprietary ideas have jumped on the Agile bandwagon that can confuse the true meaning and purpose behind Agile thinking.
* Agile methods can make just as many decisions as planning-based methods, it just makes them at different times.
* Agile thinking begins with the people using it. It is not merely a business practice or policy to be followed – it is something that must exist at the core of our being to use properly.

### Read
