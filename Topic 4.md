# Topic 4 - SCRUM Core Concepts
### Description
Scrum has become one of the most common forms of Agile delivery and is the most widely practiced and promoted, making it a de-facto standard. It forms a clear framework and allows defined methodology to be applied to the Agile philosophy. Scrum has defined concepts and structure that enables teams to work together in an aligned way on their project.

Despite being “simplistic” in comparison to more traditional methods, operating a Scrum project is not as simple is it might sound. Scrum is a guide, not a formula, and the challenges in its success lie in the variations available in its implementation. The very flexibility that can make Scrum so powerful is also often what makes it challenging to do well.


### Intended Learning
Students will explore the core concepts of the Scrum model, understanding its main principles and its overall framework. We will explore how Scrum came about, and examine its fundamental and defining traits.

### Topic Mastery
When considering your mastery of this topic you should satisfy yourself that you have obtained the following key pieces of knowledge, that you can answer the questions to ponder, and that you can explain the considerations below to a fellow professional.

1. Know the core structure that comprises Scrum, and its various components.
1. Understand the roles of Scrum, and what makes them different.
1. Be familiar with the main challenges when trying to implement Scrum to a non-scrum team.

### Questions to Ponder
Consider the following questions as a guide to understanding this topic. Ask yourself how well you understand these principles and how satisfied you are that you can explain them.

1. Why are there only three main Scrum roles, and only two individual roles?
1. What is a sprint, and how do we decide how long it should be?
1. What needs to happen every day in a Scrum project?
1. What is a user story, who makes it, and how do we use it?
1. Where are the “processes” in Scrum that other project management methods have?

### Considerations
As we explore the methods of Agile take these considerations into account when forming your own opinions.

* The ScrumMaster represents the team, whilst the Product Owner represents the customer.
* The Product Owner is responsible for prioritising what from the product backlog should go into the next sprint.
* The ScrumMaster focuses on what is going on this sprint, and how to help it go better.
* During a sprint the team should aim to deliver completed and done user stories.
* The Team becomes empowered and expected to take an active and ownership role of many of the planning decisions between and during a sprint.
