# Topic 3 - The Agile Model & Methods
### Description
As Agile is a philosophy and toolset it now encompasses many sub-methods that embrace various agile principles. Whilst they may all be called Agile in nature they still differ in many significant ways. Just as each project or team is different, so too each variation of Agile has its strengths and weaknesses. Understanding these is the key to deciding which method might suit which situation.

For large scale enterprise projects it is possible for more than one method to be operating for different teams at different times. Blending these together into a cohesive result is not as simple as it might seem for methods that all support the same philosophy.


### Intended Learning
Students will explore some of the more popular Agile sub-methods, their strengths and weaknesses, as well as considering how they can work together. The integration of any Agile method into other organisational concepts is also examined.  We will look at how these methods are similar as well as their differences.


### Topic Mastery
When considering your mastery of this topic you should satisfy yourself that you have obtained the following key pieces of knowledge, that you can answer the questions to ponder, and that you can explain the considerations below to a fellow professional.

1. Know the fundamentals of the core Agile model.
1. Be familiar with the differences between Lean, Kanban, XP and SCRUM.
1. Understand what is common among all agile sub-methods.


### Questions to Ponder
Consider the following questions as a guide to understanding this topic. Ask yourself how well you understand these principles and how satisfied you are that you can explain them.

1. Why is SCRUM the most common or popular Agile method?
1. Why have different sub-methods of Agile come into being?
1. Why are non-project elements of an organisation sometimes suspicious of Agile thinking?
1. What is envision – speculate – explore – adapt – close?
1. How is the Agile “lifecycle” different from the agile processes?


### Considerations
As we explore the methods of Agile take these considerations into account when forming your own opinions.

* Sometimes Agile can become too prescriptive to be considered agile.
* Governance is often handled differently in an Agile project.
* Stakeholder buy-in and management can be very different in Agile.
* Certain Agile methods do not translate as well between industries.
* A higher set of principles can be translated and found expressed in different sub-methods


### Read
