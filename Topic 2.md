# Topic 2 - The Agile Principles
### Description
Agile operates on a small set of fundamental principles that are the guiding focus of its philosophy. These are neither rules nor restrictions; they are neither mandates nor requirements. Instead these are a set of priorities that suggest we favour certain directions over others.

This topic explores those principles that are at the core of Agile thinking and which underpin most successful Agile methods. We look at their simplest meaning, but also at their broader implications and interpretations. This topic also dispels some of the myths and misconceptions that have arisen from these principles.

### Intended Learning
Students will examine the core principles from the Agile manifesto, the reasons for their importance, and ways in which they can be embraced and adopted. Three fundamental principles that define differences between Agile thinking and traditional projects will be focused on in detail.


### Topic Mastery
When considering your mastery of this topic you should satisfy yourself that you have obtained the following key pieces of knowledge, that you can answer the questions to ponder, and that you can explain the considerations below to a fellow professional.

1. Clearly understand the Agile Manifesto and the meaning behind its statements and principles.
1. Know the role and purpose of a Vision within the Agile framework.
1. Understand what Value means to an Agile project.

### Questions to Ponder
Consider the following questions as a guide to understanding this topic. Ask yourself how well you understand these principles and how satisfied you are that you can explain them.

* Why is the customer so crucial in our definition of value?
* How can an agile approach build confidence in the customer that their investment is not wasted?
* Why are people so important in successful Agile projects?
* What is the difference between alignment and collaboration?
* How can we ensure that adapting does not become reacting?'

### Considerations
As we explore the foundation of Agile take these considerations into account when forming your own opinions.

* There are cumulative effects from the positive reinforcement cycle that Agile methods can bring to the project team.
* Self-organising teams is an example of how important it is to have the people aligned with the Agile vision.
* Consider the parallels between Value in Agile and Quality in Waterfall.
* Consider the meaning of the term “change is our opportunity, not our threat”.
* There are things that we must still conform to within Agile.
